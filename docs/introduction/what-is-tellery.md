# What is Tellery?


Most analytics tools don't compound. Reports, presentations, dashboards are ephemeral.  Metrics defined in dashboard can not be referenced. We copy-pasting screen from one tool to another.

If any individual isn't getting compound interest from his analytics how can a collective. We start by building a tool that can help analysts effectively organize their analytics code in one place. 

We bring together analytic workflow and a layer of presentation. Want a KPI dashboard? A weekly report? A deep user research? Tellery allows you build your deliverables from dozens of building blocks. Numbers can be defined consistently and always up to date. Business users can see the context around numbers, making it possible to see how analysts arrived at the conclusions they did. Itâ€™s easy to discover and trust data across the organization.

Tellery allows you abstract essential business logic, and reference it anywhere. Define a model grasping the nuances of datasets to make explorative analysis organizable. Tellery uses SQL to model data, which means you can easily consolidates it in dbt. The further change is easy, not only to the place that defines it, but also to the place that references it.
