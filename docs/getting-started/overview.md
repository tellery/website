# Overview

There are two ways to setup Tellery:

1. [Using docker-compose](./using-docker-compose.md) (locally)
2. [Using helm](./using-helm.md) (on Kubernetes)

Using docker-compose is a quick way to tryout Tellery. It brings up all the necessary infrastructure locally. Please check [Quick Setup](./using-docker-compose.md) for details.

If you want to setup Tellery in the production environment, we recommend you using Helm to deploy Tellery on Kubernetes. Please check [Production Setup](./using-helm.md) for details.

If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster, please [contact us](mailto:contact@tellery.io) to get help.
