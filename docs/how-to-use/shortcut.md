## Markdown styling

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text for formatting syntax. Tellery **is** a Markdown editor. That means you can do things like the followingâ€¦


### List

Type `[]` to create to-do checkbox.

Use single asterisk `*` followed by a space to create bullet point.

Type `1.` followed by a space to start the numbered list.

Use two angle brackets `>>` followed by a space to start a toggle list.

In your list, press `Tab` to indent and add sub-bullets.


### Headings

Headings can be created as follows:

```
# Heading 1 (largest)
## Heading 2 
### Heading 3
```

### Others


Use single bracket `>` to capture a blockquote.

Capture a code snippet with three leading `````.

Soon, we will provide inline markdown support, such as **bold**, *italicize*, and ~~strikethrough~~
