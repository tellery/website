# Create a new thought


Ad hoc analytic code sometimes is hard to manage. Tellery allows you organize ad hoc analysis and track them into a reverse chronological view.


You can create a new "thought" each day. Feel free to drop your unformed analyses there. The newest content is always on top of the page.


You can make exploratory analysis on top of draft questions. Assess, tune and refine them before the right metric emerges.



## Calendar view


Tellery allows you to navigate a calendar view and quickly jump to the story for a specific date.
