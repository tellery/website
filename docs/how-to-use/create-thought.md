# Create a new thought


Ad hoc analytic code sometimes is hard to manage. Tellery allows you organize ad hoc analytic code and track them into a calendar view.


You can create a new "thought" each day on the "My Thought" page. 


Feel free to drop your unformed analyses there. All your thoughts are in reverse chronological order on this page. The newest content is always on top of the page.




## Calendar view


Tellery allows you to navigate a calendar view and quickly jump to the story for a specific date.


Click the "CalendarðŸ“…" icon at top right, and the calendar view will show up.
