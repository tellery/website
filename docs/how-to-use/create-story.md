# Create a new story


Click the "Create new story`+`" button at the bottom of your sidebar. 


Then the story is created in your workspace and a new empty story will pop up in front of you. You can give it a meaningful name.



## Ask a new question


:::info

For asking a question in tellery, you need to [configure a database](/docs/how-to-use/configure-database) first.

:::



Type `/` to bring up your menu of content options. Go ahead and choose "Question", then a question block will appear in the story. You can edit the name of the question.


### Edit SQL


When a new question is created, Tellery will automatically open an question editor. Start writing your SQL there.


Click the "Edit SQL`<>`" on the bottom right of any existing question block to bring up its SQL in the question editor.


### Execute SQL


You can click "Execute‚ñ∂Ô∏è" button in question editor to submit a SQL to Tellery. Tellery will query data warehouse, fetch result back, and visualize it.


###  Change the visualization


The default visualization type is `table`. To change the visualization, just click the "Visualization optionsüìä" button on the upper right of your question editor.


Or, click the "Visualization optionsüìä" on the bottom right of the question block.



## Add some narratives 


Besides the question block, you can also insert a narrative block by simply typing the `/` command.


Here‚Äôs a list of basic blocks in Tellery:


* Text
* Header
* Image
* Bulleted list
* Toggle list
* Checked list
* Separator
* Quote



Tellery provide [markdown](/docs/how-to-use/markdown) syntax you're familiar with to add your narratives. The typing experience is simple. You can put your relevant explanations to visualization, making it possible for stakeholders to understand your story.



### Drag and drop

Any text or chart in story can be dragged wherever you want it. 


Move your mouse to the block and the `‚ãÆ‚ãÆ` icon will appear to the left of it. You can drag and drop the block by holding this handle. 



### Arrange the layout


To resize a question block, you can drag the right or bottom edges of it.


Drag-and-dropping a block to the right side of another creates columns. Hove over the space between columns and you will see a separator. Drag and drop the separator to resize their width.


Change the width of story from the upper right `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` menu on your story. Making a story "Full-width" will allow you put more content horizontally.
