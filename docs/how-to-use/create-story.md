# Create a new story



Click the "+" button on the left side bar. Then the story is created in your workspace, and a new empty story will pop up in front of you. You can give it a meaningful name.



### Ask a new question


:::info

For asking a question in Tellery, you need to [configure a database](/docs/how-to-use/configure-database) first.

:::


Type `/` to bring up your menu of content options. Go ahead and choose "Question", then a question block will appear in the story. You can edit the name of the question.


### Edit SQL



When a new question is created, Tellery will automatically open a question editor. Start writing your SQL there.


Click the "Edit SQL`<>`" on the bottom right of any existing question block to bring up its SQL in the question editor.


### Execute SQL


You can click the "Execute‚ñ∂Ô∏è" button in the question editor to submit a SQL to Tellery. Tellery will query the data warehouse, fetch the result back, and visualize it.


### Change the visualization


The default visualization type is `table`. To change the visualization, just click the "Visualization optionsüìä" button on the upper right of your question editor.


Or, click the "Visualization optionsüìä" on the bottom right of the question block.

### Add your words


Besides the question block, you can also insert a narrative block by simply typing the `/` command.


Here‚Äôs a list of basic blocks in Tellery:


* Text
* Header
* Image
* Bulleted list
* Toggle list
* Checked list
* Separator
* Quote



Tellery provides [markdown](/docs/how-to-use/shortcut#markdown-styling) syntax you're familiar with to add your narratives. The typing experience is simple. You can put your relevant explanations to visualization, making it possible for stakeholders to understand your story.



### Drag and drop

Any text or chart in a story can be dragged wherever you want it.


Move your mouse to the block and the `‚ãÆ‚ãÆ` icon will appear to the left of it. You can drag and drop the block by holding this handle.



### Arrange the layout


To resize a question block, you can drag the right or bottom edges of it.


Drag-and-dropping a block to the right side of another creates columns. Hovering over the space between columns, you will see a separator. Drag and drop the separator to resize its width.


Change the width of a story from the upper right `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` menu on your story. Making a story "Full-width" will allow you to put more content horizontally.
