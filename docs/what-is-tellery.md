# What is Tellery?

Tellery is a BI tool connecting your data and team. As easy as using a notebook. As powerful as a data modelling tool.


Instead of querying on tables and columns directly, Tellery users can ask questions against Data assets, which provides a semantic layer for your data. 


- Data asset let business users extract business metrics without the assist of analysts.
- Using data asset across dashboards/reports instead of copy-pasting SQL snippets around make your business logic more consistent and easier to maintain. 
- Tellery comes with a bucket of building blocks and rich text styling features. From reports to dashboards, you can tailor it to your need to unlock the value of data asset.


See the reason [why we built Tellery](/docs/about).
