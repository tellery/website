# What is Tellery?


Tellery brings data exploration, analytical narratives and collaboration into one place. Want an anomalies investigation? A campaign-oriented dashboard? A Feature-specific analysis? They are now all in one place.


Tellery allows you abstract essential business logic, and [reference it in future analysis](/docs/how-to-use/question-referencing). Metrics are maintainable and shareable models across dashboards and reports. Tellery uses SQL to model data, so you can easily consolidate it inÂ [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/).


See the reason [why we built Tellery](/docs/about).
