# What is Tellery?

Tellery helps you organize your ad-hoc analyses and then narrate them in one place.

Tellery brings all of your words and data into one flexible surface:

 * Anomalies investigation
 * Feature-specific analysis
 * Campaign-oriented dashboard
 * Or customize your deliverable for your own needs


Tellery allows you abstract essential business logic, and reference it anywhere. You can define a model grasping the nuances of datasets to make explorative analysis organizable. Tellery uses SQL to model data, so you can easily consolidates it inÂ [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/). 


See the reason [why we built Tellery](/docs/about).
