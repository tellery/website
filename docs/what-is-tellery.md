# What is Tellery?


Tellery allows you abstract essential data transformation/business logic, and reuse it in future contexts through metrics. Metrics are **maintainable and shareable data models** across dashboards and reports. They are defined consistently and always up to date.


To deliver better value of the metrics, Tellery comes with a bucket of building blocks and rich text styling features. Want a real-time campaign-oriented dashboard? A feature-specific analysis? An anomalies investigation? You can tailor it to your need to unlock the value of data.


See the reason [why we built Tellery](/docs/about).
