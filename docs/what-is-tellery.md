# What is Tellery?


Tellery brings data exploration, analytical narratives and collaboration into one place. Want an anomalies investigation? A campaign-oriented dashboard? A feature-specific analysis report? They are now all in one place.


You can even define a model grasping the nuance of datasets. Tellery allows you abstract essential business logic, and reuse it in future contexts. Metrics are **maintainable and shareable models** across dashboards and reports. They are defined consistently and always up to date.


See the reason [why we built Tellery](/docs/about).
