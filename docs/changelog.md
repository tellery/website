## v0.6.0 (Aug 4, 2021)

Weâ€™re excited to introduce Metric in Tellery. A metric is essentially a wrapper that lets you embed a piece of SQL from one question into other questions. It's based on the mechanism of referencing question. 


You can convert any question into Metric and explore it in any stories with drag-and-drop ease. All available metrics in the system will be listed on the left side of your story. ðŸ•¶
