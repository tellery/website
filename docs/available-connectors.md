# Available Connectors

Right at the time a Tellery workspace was initialized, the first thing that comes to mind would be how to bring your own data into Tellery.

We provide connectors of mainstream cloud data warehouses to help you explore your own data in an easy and almost zero-configuration way. All you need to do is just clicking into workspace settings and [adding a profile](/docs/how-to-use/configure-database) to connect with your data warehouse.

So far we support the following:

| **Connector for** |                         **Documentation**                         |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     Snowflake     |   [Profile Setup](/docs/how-to-use/configure-database#Snowflake)  |
|     Redshift      |   [Profile Setup](/docs/how-to-use/configure-database#Redshift)   |
|     PostgreSQL    |   [Profile Setup](/docs/how-to-use/configure-database#PostgreSQL) |
