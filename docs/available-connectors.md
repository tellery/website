# Available Connectors

Right at the time a Tellery workspace were initialized, the first thing comes to mind would be how to bring your own data into Tellery.

We provides connector of mainstream cloud data warehouses to help you explore your own data in a easy and almost zero-configuration way. All you need to do is just clicking into workspace settings and adding a profile to connect with your data warehouse.

Meanwhile, if your data warehouse were deployed on-premise or even in an isolated environment, you could also bridge it to Tellery by deploying a connector by yourself with simple configuration. For more details, check [detailed connector configurations](/docs/getting-started/connector-deployment)

So far we supports the following:
