## Why we built Tellery?

The last few years have seen an explosion in a number of analytics tools in an emerging ecosystem, called modern data stack. Dashboards brought visibility into the business. Looker helped business users to do self-service analytics. Transformation tool like dbt created a solid foundation which everyone can share. 

We use dozens of tools to get our work done. We too often copy-paste screenshots of charts from one tool to another. We conduct duplicated analysis that a colleague had already done. Metrics are scattered across tools and recreated with no oversight. The modern data stack makes it easy to answer questions, but hard to answer them consistently.

We start by building a tool that brings data exploration, analytical narratives and collaboration **into one place**. Want an anomalies investigation? A campaign-oriented dashboard? A feature-specific analysis report? 
They are now all in one place.

Tellery brings words and data into one flexible surface, where you can organize visualizations with drag-and-drop ease. Tell story your way.

You can even define a model grasping the nuance of datasets. Tellery allows you abstract essential business logic, and reuse it in future contexts. Metrics are **maintainable and shareable models** across dashboards and reports. They are defined consistently and always up to date.

Stakeholders can see the context around numbers, making it possible to see how analysts arrived at the conclusions they did.
