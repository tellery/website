## Why we built Tellery? 


The last few years has seen an explosion in number of analytics tools in an emerging ecosystem, called modern data stack.  Dashboarding tools brought visibility into business. Looker made analytics tool self-servable. But a long tail of custom questions can not be answered using dashboards or self-serve tools.


We believe that analysts have an ad-hoc analysis problem. We too often copy-paste screenshot of charts from one tool to another. Metrics buried dashboard can not be referenced elsewhere. We conduct duplicated analysis that a colleague had already done. The modern data stack makes it easy to answer questions, but really hard to answer it consistently.


Most analytics tools don't compound. Most data analysis, narrated in reports, decks, dashboards, notebooks are ephemeral. This is the start problem. They are always consolidated answers to questions. Few tools help us develop the exploratory analysis. If any individual isn't getting compound interest from his analytics how can a collective. We start by building a tool that can help analysts organize analyses and then narrate them in one place.


We bring together analytic workflow and a presentation layer. Tellery comes with a handful of building blocks, like visualization and bullet list. Want an anomalies investigation? A Feature-specific analysis? A campaign-oriented dashboard? You can customize your deliverables for your own needs. Tell story your own way.


Tellery allows you abstract essential business logic, and reuse it in future contexts. Define a model grasping the nuances of datasets to make exploratory analysis organizable. Metrics are defined consistently and always up to date. Stakeholders can see the context around numbers, making it possible to see how analysts arrived at the conclusions they did.
